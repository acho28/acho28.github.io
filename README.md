Project 2

Inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure and Dungeon Keeper.

Branching storyline that ends in death most times.

[Bug] Can mute sound by uncommenting the mute button in the js file, but it removes the other prompts.

[Unimplemented] Unused sound libraries [picClick1 ~ picClick6] Possible later integration with imagery and snarky comments about how you're not supposed to click those.

[#AD] VO services available. Contact Boundlessbnd@gmail.com or follow @boundless_endo on insta and shoot a DM.

No image library this time.

Project 3

Mood Music: Design based on old scammy looking websites. Claims to utilize mood to create a personalized song recommendation but is actually used to self-promote and promote related content that has been curated beforehand.
